{% include content/heading.html type="h2" title="THE COBALT & ELECTRICITY DECKER HALL OF FAME" %}

Welcome to the Hall of Fame, where all the aces from the ZONE are commemorated with their names in lights- or as best we can manage with the power situation being what it is in HALIFAX_1. Check this webspace for the names of all the heroes who get us through the day out in this lonely little timeline we call 'home'. 

{% include content/heading.html type="h3" title="ELECTRIC KNIGHTS" %}

_The Electric Knights stand silent guard over HALIFAX_1, ever watchful, awaiting the return of the enemy from beyond the stars._

{% include content/heading.html type="h3" title="KOBRA DRAGOONS" %}

_Heroes from the last great war, soldiers of freedom and justice, walking among us in secret._
