Hey Gang!

So, rough times, but the Life Comix library got slagged when the Battery went nuclear (much like everything else in a 1km radius around the harbour), so we're still picking through what's left of those old HDDs to get everything back up and running. Don't worry, everyone's favourite scamps will be back in the game before too long.
