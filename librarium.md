title: CYBER-LIBRARIUM
---

Welcome to the Flyknife Comics Cyber-Librarium! Here you can flip through all the books published by Flyknife Comics, from the rollicking adventures of Snakes Leningrad and Captain Gunsmoke to the drug-addled furry fever dreams of STONR GARBAGE. I really only do two things, I guess is what I'm saying. But I have many books!

The Librarium functionality is still under construction, but we're hoping to expand it soon. Until that time, enjoy the 	bare-bones version and if you run into any trouble, just hop on the Tweetodome and "at" my web-wave at FlyknifeComics.
