Electricity here,

So after we plugged the CyberHalberd Reactive Intelligence System into VICTOR and started mucking around with its core functionality,
we found this folder spun off the root that it'd periodically write new files to. Cobalt thinks it's some kind of procedural
novel generator, but my thoughts tend towards some kind of diagnostic or logfile. Frankly, C.H.R.I.S himself has been pretty mum
on the subject, so I figured I'd toss 'em up on the Griddzone and see how he likes THAT. I've indexed them as best I can.
