**LIFE COMIX:** Bad dreams and hard days under the rock-solid dome of Atlas City. Can Bruce and Chris keep the rumble rolling, or is the last dome on Earth about to crumble?

**[THE LIFE COMIX 2014 CHILLED-OUT SUMMERTIME JAM](https://tapastic.com/series/life-comix-jam):** The original Snakepunk comic. Originally published for **Hal-Con 2014**, the *Jam* represents the triumphant return of the 90s' hottest fandom. Get Jazz.

**[STONR GARBAGE](https://tapastic.com/series/stonr-garbage):** Stop by the picturesque town of Gordon Downs for a spell. Kick up your feet and laugh along with classic characters like Ricky Thousand-Joints, Ricky Thousand-Joints' Doppelganger, and Stellarton Crendle in this zany, drug fuelled comedy about loneliness, alienation, and the crushing fear that all agency is illusory.
