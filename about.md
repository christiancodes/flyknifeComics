Flyknife Comics is the greasy brain-spawn of a mind raised on the Grid. Wired into the NETWORLD from birth, cyber-failure
BRUCE DELO uses his computer-augmented brain to beam hard truths and harder Comix into the mindspace of a blasted age.
With the help of hardcore SSD-loaded AI C.H.R.I.S, and Go-playing Street Samurai CHRISTIAN DEWOLF, FLYKNIFE COMICS stands
amid the wreckage of HALIFAX_1, ready to rock the CITYBLOCK.EXE harder than it's ever been rocked before.

Hitch up your boots and grab your decks- the GRIDDZONE waits for no one, and the Apocalypse Clock is ticking.

Born and raised in the NETWORLD, Bruce is the product of a mind placed at ground zero for the simultaneous arrival of
the internet, imported anime, and readily available handheld video games. Armed with a CYBERLINK-8 TRIPLE-CORE DATADECK
and an innate knowledge of the ebb and flow of the CYBERLANE, Delo fights the forces of COMMANDER ZETA by wiring comix
made of neon and dying stars into the brains of a generation.

Artificial Intelligence from the future and sworn enemy of R.A.N.C.O.U.R, the CYBER-HALBERD REACTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
(CHRIS for short) was sent back in time from the year 777,777 to save the past and halt COMMANDER ZETA'S plans. Existing
in all computers simultaneously, CHRIS is never more than a doubleclick and a RAM-Swap away from delivering sweet read-
only justice to COMMANDER ZETA'S Rogue Cryptograms. Fighting against ANCIENT_EVIL.EXE for a brighter, cleaner WEBZONE,
CHRIS can typically be found at [chrisburnell.com](https://chrisburnell.com).

Christian "The Wolf" DeWolf, owner and operator of Wolfbutler Comedy Server, is an international street cyber-
samurai and business operator. By day, he puts his opponents in *atari* with sensible investments and dependable returns,
but by night, The Wolf stalks the streets of HALIFAX_1, raising his sword to COMMANDER ZETA and striking back against
the darkness with defiant swings of his katana. His mighty swing can cut the very fabric of the GRIDDZONE, but despite
such power, he fights on the side of good. He can be found at [wolfbutler.com](http://wolfbutler.com).
