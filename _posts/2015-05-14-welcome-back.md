Hello and welcome to the redesigned Flyknife Comics website! We had to redesign after the old data sites were fragged when the Battery went pearwise, but we're set up in a much more stable webspace now. That means we can keep delivering high-quality content to you every week, without delay or pause.

I'll take this opportunity to welcome all you new deckers and deckettes to the Zone. I'm Bruce, and I run this outfit. From this webzone you can expect to see comics, GRIDD news, and all the hot tips and tricks to keep your lights on and your decks blinking.

I'll get right to it, kids and skids, so take it breezy and lock in your GRIDD-coordinates. It's gonna be hard firin' from here on out so don't waste any time- the Apocalypse Clock is tickin'.

_Bruce_
