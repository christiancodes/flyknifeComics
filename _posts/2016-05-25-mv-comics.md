Hi all, 

Short update, big news, small fries- we're moving the comics over to the remnants of Tapastic! We thought the site got burned when the Battery went nuclear, but C.H.R.I.S just picked up the signal. Looks like somebody's keeping the broadcast alive out there!

So you can now read the entirety of *The Life Comix 2014 Chilled-Out Summertime Jam* plus the first issue of *STONR GARBAGE* on our tapastic page, [here](https://tapastic.com/brucedelo/series). *Kobra Stallion Volume 1* will be making its way there in the not-too-distant future. And anything else to come will also find its way there, and we'll be sure to post updates here and on the company Twitter (@FlyknifeComics) whenever something new goes up. So g'wan, have a look, and enjoy!
