LATEST BINARY ORDER DISPATCH:

    Priest-Commander Militant to all Programmers-At-Arms,
    Do not heed the words of the Cube. The Cube lies. The Cube seduces. Remain vigilant in all things lest the heretic song of the Cube divert you from the path. If you, or one of your subordinates, have fallen under the influence of the Cube, report to the nearest Immolator as soon as convenient.
    Priest-Commander Militant Archibald Von Neumann
