Here it is, your too-late-to-be-useful reminder that I'll be at Geequinox this coming weekend! I'll be at table 17, right next to hacker scuzzbag and personal friend Christian Dewolf, selling comic books in a variety of patterns and colours for your immediate intravenous consumption.

Just so's you know how much cash to bring, here's a quick rundown on pricing:  
_Kobra Stallion Vol. 2: Radical Astral Tilt_ ... $30  
_Starbreakers: Gunstar Runaways of the Rebel Sky Vol.1_ ... $25  
_Any individual STONR GARBAGE issue_ ... $15  

And because I'm such a nice guy, there are DEALS too! Head on down to the DEAL ZONE, spend less money and GET MORE STUFF!  
_KS2 and SB1 together_ ... $50  
_Any 2 STONR GARBAGE issues_ ... $25  
_Any 3 STONR GARBAGE issues_ ... $30  
_Any 4 STONR GARBAGE issues_ ... $35  
_All 6 books_ ... $60  

We also have a _Starbreakers_ poster that's $10 or free with any purchase that includes _Starbreakers_. And, per usual, I'll be drawing stupid drawings through the day which will be free with any purchase if you're into that stuff like that. 

ALSO! Please note that while Kobra Stallion 1 and the Jam are not available for hard-copy sale, they are both _totally free_ on _this very site_ [right here at this link](https://flyknifecomics.com/librarium/). Read them and find out if you like them! Sick of people comin' by my table not knowin' if they want my wares or not. I'm a busy man! Have a little respect!

Can't wait to see you all there!
